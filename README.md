# Assessing the genetic diversity of RMBL aspen

Author: Alyssa Phillips

Snakemake pipeline pipeline for calling variants and estimating diversity across RMBL quaking aspen. This repository follows a CookieCutter directory structure.

Data source: [https://doi.org/10.26078/JNPN-4A13](https://doi.org/10.26078/JNPN-4A13) & SRA BioProject PRJNA1063753

## Running the pipeline

`rm -r .snakemake/log  .snakemake/metadata .snakemake/slurm_logs`
`snakemake --executor slurm --profile profiles/ --use-conda --rerun-triggers input`

1. Pre-processing of reads
* Assess read quality with fastqc
* Trim reads with fastp and re-evaluate quality. Reads are trimmed via sliding windows (4 bp windows, min quality of 15) and automated detection of adapters.

2. Mapping
* Map reads to the reference with bwa-mem2. RMBL reads were mapped as pair-end (-p) and all other reads were mapped as single-end reads.
* Sort and add read groups to BAM files with samtools and GATK.
* Assess mapping quality with Qualimap's bamqc.

3. Variant calling
* BCFtools is used to call variants.
	RMBL raw SNPs: 3,942,970
        Spectral raw SNPs: 1,504,711
* Variants are seperately filtered for RMBL spatial dataset & spectral dataset. Variants were hard filtered to keep QUAL > 30, MQ > 30, and biallelic sites
        RMBL SNPs after hard filters: 1,413,730 (5,743,199 records and 467,026 SNPs with vcftools rule)
        Spectral raw SNPs: 739,735
* Multiple depth and genotype missingness filters were tested.
 	RMBL 3 < DP < 30 & 10%: 26,475 
	RMBL 1 < DP < 30 & 10%: 111,953
        Spectral 1 < DP < 30 & 10%: 51,158
        Spectral 1 < DP < 30 & 20%: 175,489
        Spectral 1 < DP < 30 & 25%: 221,132

4. Ploidy determination
* Ploidy was previously estimated for a majority of samples using [gbs2ploidy](https://doi.org/10.32614/CRAN.package.gbs2ploidy)
* We are replicating these analyses using heterozygous sites only, as called by `bcftools call`.

5. Genotyping
* Updog (https://dcgerard.github.io/updog/index.html) will be used to estimate genotypes. This software considers sequencing error, allele bias, and overdispersion. The input of updog is read counts for SNPs, so variats must be called and initially filtered prior to genotype calling.
* After genotyping, an LD filter will be applied

6. Kinship matrix for Spectral Data Gentoypes

7. Modified MAR on RMBL datasets 
* Run the MAR pipeline assuming everything is diploid genotypes. We are running this just for the sampling. The script is `scripts/mar.R`.
* Then we use a custom script to estimate nucleotide diversity and watterson's theta for the sampled groups.
